Things Changing

	Minor adjustments to 
		Throttle Control
		Steering Control
	
	Layout Changes

 5V Protection

	5V goes through diode to prevent the 5v and GND being swapped and messing things up
	goes through thermistor to prevent spikes of current
	Zener Diode prevents overvoltage (over 5.1V)

	Possibly Fix Fuse (i dont know if it really does anything at this moment)
